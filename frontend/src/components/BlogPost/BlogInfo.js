        Vladimir Nabokov, “The Gift.” 96 words. “As he crossed toward the
        pharmacy at the corner he involuntarily turned his head because of a
        burst of light that had ricocheted from his temple, and saw, with that
        quick smile with which we greet a rainbow or a rose, a blindingly white
        parallelogram of sky being unloaded from the van—a dresser with mirrors
        across which, as across a cinema screen, passed a flawlessly clear
        reflection of boughs sliding and swaying not arboreally, but with a
        human vacillation, produced by the nature of those who were carrying
        this sky, these boughs, this gliding façade.” Jose Saramago,
        “Blindness.” 97 words. “On offering to help the blind man, the man who
        then stole his car, had not, at that precise moment, had any evil
        intention, quite the contrary, what he did was nothing more than obey
        those feelings of generosity and altruism which, as everyone knows, are
        the two best traits of human nature and to be found in much more
        hardened criminals than this one, a simple car-thief without any hope of
        advancing in his profession, exploited by the real owners of this
        enterprise, for it is they who take advantage of the needs of the poor.”
        Vladimir Nabokov, “Lolita.” 99 words. “My very photogenic mother died in
        a freak accident (picnic, lightning) when I was three, and, save for a
        pocket of warmth in the darkest past, nothing of her subsists within the
        hollows and dells of memory, over which, if you can still stand my style
        (I am writing under observation), the sun of my infancy had set: surely,
        you all know those redolent remnants of day suspended, with the midges,
        about some hedge in bloom or suddenly entered and traversed by the
        rambler, at the bottom of a hill, in the summer dusk; a furry warmth,
        golden midges.” Laurence Sterne, “The Life and Opinions of Tristram
        Shandy.” 107 words. “The French are certainly misunderstood: — but
        whether the fault is theirs, in not sufficiently explaining themselves,
        or speaking with that exact limitation and precision which one would
        expect on a point of such importance, and which, moreover, is so likely
        to be contested by us — or whether the fault may not be altogether on
        our side, in not understanding their language always so critically as to
        know “what they would be at” — I shall not decide; but ‘tis evident to
        me, when they affirm, “That they who have seen Paris, have seen every
        thing,” they must mean to speak of those who have seen it by day-light.”
